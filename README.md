Generator for Nurikabe puzzles. Generates both the puzzle and solution, and also makes sure that the puzzle only has one solution (not guaranteed, it might be possible that some puzzles have more than one solution as it is very difficult to verify if each puzzle it generates has one solution).
Run it on Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MrEk5eZIq0KZ5Pb2qUhuBhrxBzcmfWJU?usp=sharing
Also generates a printable PDF to view the puzzles.
